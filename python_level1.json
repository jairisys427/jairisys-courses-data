          "content": "Python is a powerful, high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. Python is open-source and works on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and more. It supports multiple programming paradigms, such as object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming."

Python has a massive community and countless libraries, so help and tools are always available. Itâ€™s one of the most in-demand programming languages in the world. Whether you're building websites, analyzing data, automating tasks, scripting, working with IoT, or developing games and appsâ€”Python can help you do it all!"

Statements end simply by going to a new lineâ€”no semicolons required! This simplicity in structure allows beginners to focus more on logic and less on punctuation rules."
